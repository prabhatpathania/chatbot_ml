chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms.', 'Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.', 'Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause.', 'Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without

about 1 million filtering units.', 'Each unit, called a glomerulus, connects to a tubule, which collects urine.', 'Conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes take a toll on kidney function by
